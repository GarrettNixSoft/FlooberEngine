# FlooberEngine
A basic 2D game engine in Java, built using LWJGL 3. I use this engine for my personal projects.

Current features:
- Basic 2D rendering capabilities (quads, textured quads, circles)
- Simple particle system with configurable particle behaviors
- Configurable loaders to load assets on game startup
- Simple audio system
- TileMaps and basic lighting for tiles and textured quads
